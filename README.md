# 🔬 Data Analysis & Modeling Projects

Welcome to my data lab — a collection of projects where raw datasets are transformed into meaningful insights, predictive models, and structured relationships. This repository is built to showcase end-to-end thinking: from understanding messy data to building systems that reveal patterns and power decisions.

## 🌱 Why This Repo Exists

I'm passionate about breaking down real-world problems and building logic-driven solutions with data. This repo is part of my journey as a data analyst and aspiring data scientist — and I'm sharing it to learn, grow, and maybe even help others do the same.
