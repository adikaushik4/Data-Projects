In this project we made two dashboards using Streamlit. Streamlit is a very common and easy to use python library.
Streamlit is often used to deploy small ML apps.

///////////////////////
Project 1: We pick few stocks and add them to the portfolio. Then compare their returns over time and plot a line chart. We also compare the returns with the benchmark of index S&P returns.

//////////////////////
Project 2: Time series analysis and building dashoboard. We pull the componenets/stocks from S&P 500 and find out the winner based on the index returns during a time frame. In the end we plot the stiock that gave the most return and against the stock that fell the most.
